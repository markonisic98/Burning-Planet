"Our Planet Is on Fire: Who Do We Look to for Guidance?" is a deep-dive statistical analysis into the factors which influence a country's GHG emissions, with the goal to identify a few key factors which we can control to curb our emissions. Various machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques are used in the final project. Please see the Final Project pdf for the full paper. I have also attached the key R code files used for this projectâ€™s statistical analyses and data visualizations. Data gathering and transformation was done in a separate R file.

This was my final project for a masters-level statistics course at McGill University, completed in the latter-half of 2020.
